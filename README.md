b-selectable
============
This Web Component allows single (for now) selection of an item in a list.

The attribute "selected" indicates which item element is being selected, and can also be used to select an item programmatically.

```html
<b-selectable selected="0">
    <div>Item 1</div>
    <div>Item 2</div>
    <div>Item 3</div>
</b-selectable>
```

The attribute "target" defines a selector used to query nodes to be used for selectable items.

```html
<b-selectable target="li">
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
</b-selectable>
```

Whenever the selected item changes, a "b-selected" event will be fired. The user can use the keyboard to select an item: Up/Down.

If the user clicks/taps on an item, it will be selected AND then activated (a "b-activate" event will be fired just after the "b-selected"). If using keyboard, type ENTER to activate the selected item.

b-selectable is not styled.  You need to style the "b-selectable-selected" CSS class to style the selected element.

```css
.b-selectable-selected {
    background-color: #ccc;
}
```
